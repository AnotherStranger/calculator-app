# How to develop

## Style guide

General idea above style guide is:
"All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed."

Curent style guide for ubuntu-calculator-app is:
    https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js

When you creating code, every function/variable name should be meaningful and has easy to understand form. The names should reveal intent of creator. With good names you even do not need an comments. The code is documentting itself. We should avoid comments if it is not necessary.
If someone during review, ask you to add comment then you should check if names are reveal your intent.
